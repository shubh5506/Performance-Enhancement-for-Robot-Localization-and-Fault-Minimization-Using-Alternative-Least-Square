# Performance-Enhancement-for-Robot-Localization-and-Fault-Minimization-Using-Alternative-Least-Square

The purpose is to investigate proper machine learning tools for the SFU Mountain data-set. Impact: Revealing the appropriate machine learning tools will guide us to build a better data model. We are conducting semi-structured woodlands for fault diagnosis of how environmental variables affect the availability of important robotic services. Using a modeling framework, we are creating future scenarios of robotic service availability based upon local knowledge and climate projections.   In addition, we are developing models derived from inputs to compare and potentially combine with local knowledge inputs.  This allows us to assess, from several perspectives, how a critical component of community flexibility cans revolution in the future.  Perfect productivities will be used to simplify deliberations in the groups on variation options that could minimize the negative consequences while seizing upon positive opportunities.
